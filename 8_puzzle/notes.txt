   The goal was to create code to solve the 8 puzzle game. 8 puzzle is a 3 by 3 grid and within it
   there are 8 numbered tiles and 1 empty tile to move around. Our goal was to get them in order from 1-8
   To code this we used A* algorithm. After doing some research, for Board.java, i understood that the hamming distance
   is just the # of tiles in wrong place and Manhattan distance or Heuristic is estimate distance for the tile to its
   goal state. Board.java also checks if solvable by seeing if even or odd. Solver actually solves the puzzle by using
   boards solvable function. Solver wants to get from the begininning to the goal in quickest way possible. A good way
   to think about it is like a mouse in a maze and at the end of the maze there is cheese. and by going through each
   node and finding the shortest path then the smell gets stronger and stronger until it reaches the cheese. That is a
   way to think of 8puzzle.
