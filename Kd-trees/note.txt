   The goal of this project was to create a symbol table data which is a
   data structure and its keys are 2 dimensional points. We also use 2dTrees
   which is a binary tree that is built to help us find and take in specific points.
   We are finding all the points ina rectangle, and it can be used for mny taske such
   as classifying objects in space, or in an image, or for example, searching on
   your phone gas stations and it gives you gas stations within a radius. BrutePointST
   is used to store the two dimentional points and can help search and filter for points
   within a certain area using red black binary search tree which keeps everything balanced
   and and organized like a dictionary. ANd Kdtreepoint is also important. it helped organize
   the points in a 2 dimentional space. BAsically, instead of searching from the left or right,
   it would search through different dimentions through the tree, and this process helps find points
   more quickly because of how its organized.
