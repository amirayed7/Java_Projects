   The point of this project was to build a program that will autocomplete what a user would
   want to type out based off of its weight or importance/relevance. In the first problem,
   We are basically taking a list of words and sorting them in order like a dictionary, by
   their relevance, or by their first a couple of characters. Next for Binary search deluxe,
   you are searching through the indexes to find the specific key needed and are saved in
   first and last indexes and return them. This helps autocomplete be more useful. Lastly,
   problem 3, Autocomplete, uses the previous problems to implement. It uses Binary search
   to find the letters that match and terms to sort them.
