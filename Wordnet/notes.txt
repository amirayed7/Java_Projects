   THe goal was to create Wordnet which lets us see how words can be connected
   to each-other. for example, cow and sheep and be related as animals. THis can also be used
   to find common books or articles which can be about the same genre and many other uses. In wordnet
   we are able to see how words are connected. And to find words that are the most
   closely related to each-other, we use the shortest common ancestor. Then, in outcast,
   you find the word that doesn't seem like it belongs with the rest. THis can help get better
   results.
